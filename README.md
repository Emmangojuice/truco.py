# truco.py
This is my first project ever with my very little knowledge of coding in general in hopes of getting better.


So I finna out my thoughts into this first 

Since i gonna make the card game TRUCO i gotta break down the game first 


The game is a 2-6 player game where goal is the get 12 points at the end. 
One player is the first to shuffle and deal. The dealer is allowed to look at the faces of the cards while shuffling so as to be able to place certain cards at certain spots within the deck. The cards must be dealt counter-clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's right. They can be dealt one at a time or, most commonly, three at a time. If the cortador chooses not to reshuffle, they can deal their and their partner's cards in advance.

Each round is worth 1 point but you can up the stakes by yelling TRUCO thus increasing the pts to 3. The opposite team gets to accept or decline with a penalty of your team getting a free point. 

At any point during the game any of the players can raise the stakes by saying truco. When a player asks for truco, the opposing team has three options:

Accept: the round is now worth three points;
Fold: the team that asked for truco gets one point;
Raise the stakes even further by asking for 6 (this can also be done later at any point if the team chooses to accept the truco).
If the team chooses to ask for 6 the round is now worth three points. The opposing team (the one who asked for truco) has the same three options:

Accept: the round is now worth six points;
Fold: the team that asked for 6 gets three points;
Raise the stakes even further by asking for 9.



The cards in the following order, from strongest to weakest:

3s
2s
Aces
Kings
Jacks
Queens
7s
6;
5s
4s

8s, 9s and 10s are never included. Upon agreement, the 7s, 6s, 5s, and 4s can be removed from the deck, this is called playing with a clean deck



As you can see, the game has a similarity to poker. So using the game of war that if found and replicated , I can use that as a basis while finding aspects of coded poker games in python to use as inspiration.
